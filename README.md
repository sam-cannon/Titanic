# Titanic
This is a great beginners template for logistic regression and classifier stacking in the Titanic data competition on Kaggle. I scored in the top 7% with this fairly simple and straightforward notebook. My goal here is for other people to learn from it as they dip their toes into logistic regression and simple data preprocessing. GREAT BEGINNER COMPETITION


I really tried to keep this notebook super easy to follow and duplicate, rather than packed with text about 
hyperparameters or more specific details that might be too confusing for someone first starting out. My goal here is to provide a 
document that can be looked at by someone looking to get into their first data science competition and picked up as a starting point template.
I am sure that there is more feature engineering that can happen here, but like I said, treating it as a template was the point so that 
people could come up with their own solutions moving forward with it... If you have any questions about anything in here please email me
